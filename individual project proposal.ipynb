    "Research Question: What patterns can be observed in the timing, response type, and completion rates of the CSCS surveys?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables to Explore:\n",
    "SURVEY_start_date and SURVEY_end_date: These variables will allow us to see the timing of surveys, which may reveal patterns or trends in survey participation over time.\n",
    "SURVEY_response_type: Understanding the different response types (e.g., completed, partial) will help determine overall response behaviors.\n",
    "SURVEY_progress: By analyzing completion rates, we can gauge participant engagement and identify points where participants may drop out or fail to complete the survey.\n",
    "Justification for Choosing Variables:\n",
    "These variables together allow us to understand survey response patterns over time, providing insight into engagement. High or low completion rates could highlight areas for improvement in survey design or delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploration Approach:\n",
    "Time Series Plot: Plotting the dates from SURVEY_start_date to SURVEY_end_date can highlight trends in survey participation. Peaks or dips in survey responses might correlate with specific events or timeframes.\n",
    "Bar Chart for SURVEY_response_type: This visualization will show the proportions of different response types, providing an overview of response behavior. A breakdown of response types can help determine if participants are more likely to complete or partially complete surveys.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "It is assumed that survey completion rates and types reflect overall engagement and that any trends observed in response patterns may generalize to similar survey contexts.\n",
    "Hypothesis and Expected Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: There will be higher engagement and completion rates during specific periods (e.g., around notable events, deadlines, or seasonal occurrences), with lower rates at other times.\n",
    "Expected Results: Analysis may reveal high participation periods or patterns of engagement variation by response type. For example, certain times might see more completed surveys, while others show more partial responses. This could help CSCS adjust survey timings to optimize response rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance to Research Question:\n",
    "Importance: By identifying trends in timing, response types, and completion rates, CSCS can improve survey scheduling and design, leading to better data collection, higher response rates, and potentially more accurate feedback for program evaluation.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Demographic Variables: Age, region, and potentially other demographic data if available, to capture background information on different participant groups. SURVEY_progress: This variable reflects survey completion rates, which will serve as an indicator of engagement levels across demographic groups. Justification for Choosing Variables: Understanding engagement differences based on demographic factors can provide insights into which groups are more or less responsive. This information is essential for tailoring engagement strategies to specific groups and increasing overall participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploration Approach: Confidence Interval Comparison: Construct bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals for the mean SURVEY_progress within each demographic group. This method will allow us to assess whether differences in engagement levels between groups are statistically significant. Box Plot by Demographic: Visualizing SURVEY_progress by demographics, such as age and region, helps highlight differences in engagement trends and identify outliers. Box plots are particularly useful here for comparing central tendencies and variability across groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis Plan: Calculate Confidence Intervals: For each demographic group, use bootstrapping to generate a 95% confidence interval for the mean of SURVEY_progress. This will involve repeatedly sampling with replacement to generate an interval that likely contains the true mean engagement level for each group. Visualize Engagement by Demographic: Generate box plots to display the distribution of SURVEY_progress across different demographics. This visualization will allow us to visually assess whether certain demographics show distinct patterns in survey completion rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions: Assumes that the survey engagement represented by SURVEY_progress is reflective of broader engagement patterns in similar contexts. Assumes that age and region have meaningful associations with engagement, which we expect to manifest as statistically significant differences in SURVEY_progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis and Expected Results: Hypothesis: Engagement may vary by demographic factors. For example, younger age groups or participants from certain regions may have higher completion rates. Expected Results: Confidence intervals might reveal significant differences in SURVEY_progress across demographic groups, suggesting that engagement varies by age, region, or other factors. This could indicate that certain groups are more inclined to complete the survey, while others show lower levels of engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance to Research Question: Importance: Identifying which demographic groups are more or less engaged can inform targeted strategies for improving survey participation and program engagement. For instance, if younger participants show lower completion rates, tailored follow-up methods might be employed to increase engagement within this group.\n"

    "Scatter Plot and Regression Line: Plotting participation metrics against outcome metrics will visually reveal any trends or associations between participation and outcomes. Adding a linear regression line can help assess the strength and direction of the relationship.\n",

    "Analysis Plan:\n",
    "Fit a Simple Linear Regression Model: Use simple linear regression to predict the outcome metric based on participation metrics. This will allow us to quantify the relationship between participation and outcomes.\n",
    "Interpret Slope and Significance: Examine the slope of the regression line to determine if the relationship is positive or negative. Check the significance of the regression coefficient to see if the relationship is statistically meaningful.\n",

    "Hypothesis and Expected Results:\n",
    "Hypothesis: Greater participation (measured in terms of frequency/duration) is associated with improved outcome metrics, suggesting that continued engagement in the program contributes to better results for participants.\n",
    "Expected Results: A positive slope in the regression model would indicate that higher participation is predictive of better outcomes, providing empirical support for the effectiveness of CSCS programs.\n",

    "Relevance to Research Question:\n",
    "Importance: If the analysis shows a positive relationship between participation and outcomes, this would reinforce the importance of consistent engagement in CSCS programs. Findings could guide program modifications to encourage regular attendance, potentially improving overall program impact.\n"
